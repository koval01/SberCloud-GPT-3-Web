This project is not something serious, I developed it when I was just bored. Here is a terrible kind of code and there may be bugs. I periodically refine this project for the same reason as described above, I come here when I need to.

Initially, this web interface was developed for porfirevich.ru, later I decided to translate it to SberCloud GPT-3.
